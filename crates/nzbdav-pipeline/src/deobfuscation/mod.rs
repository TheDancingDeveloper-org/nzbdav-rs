//! Deobfuscation pipeline — resolve real filenames for NZB files.
//!
//! Many Usenet posts use obfuscated filenames (hashes, UUIDs) in the NZB
//! subject line. The deobfuscation pipeline resolves real filenames by:
//!
//! 1. Fetching the first segment of each file to detect file types and compute
//!    a 16KB MD5 hash.
//! 2. Finding and parsing the smallest PAR2 index file for its file descriptors
//!    (which contain real filenames and 16KB hashes).
//! 3. Matching NZB files to PAR2 descriptors by comparing 16KB MD5 hashes.
